# Flashcards

## Description

A flashcards program utilising the spaced repetition methodology for better memorisation. Especially useful for learning the vocabulary of a new language or for definitions of new terminology.

Developed in hopes of making a program with a simpler and more user-friendly interface than Anki, another flashcard software which I used extensively while learning Norwegian and found it quite unintuitive.

## Architecture

### Backend

The backend is written in Java with Spring Boot. Also makes use of Hibernate, Jakarta, and PostgreSQL.

### Frontend

The frontend is written with React.js and uses TailwindCSS for better styling, though it can only go so far with my lack of frontend design skills.
